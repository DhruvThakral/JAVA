//Important Logics:

// For finding the last digit of number:   number % 10 ;

// For Swaping the numbers(num1 , num2) using Bitwise XOR:   
//         Step 1: num1 = (num1) ^ (num2);
//         Step 2: num2 = (num1) ^ (num2);
//         Step 3: num1 = (num1) ^ (num2);

// Ex.: x=4 , y=5 ==> Find x-- * y--  ==>Answer: 20

// main : Serves as the entry point of the program and executes the code.

//In  Java, a string is enclosed in double quotes and not in single quotes.

//In Java , 
// int numberSeven = 0b111 ==> In Binary
// int  numberNine = 011  ==> Octal
// int  numberZero = 0x0  ==>Hexadecimal ==> Both uppercase and lowercase letters can be used when representing hex values like 60 can be  writtern as : 0xA0  or   0Xa0

// Data type  ==> default ==0            Wrapper Class ==> default == null
// int                                      Integer         both can be used
// Same for others data type.

//If two or more operators of equal precedence are used , the expression evaluation happens from left to right.

// 1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
//     It provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those progrms which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

// 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
//     It is a set of software tools and libraries + other files which are used for developing and it provides the runtime environment.

// 3. JDK (Java Development Kit)
//     It helps us to develop Java appliations, it contains JRE + development tools.

// JVM JRE JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different however JAva is platform independent.
